# Usage
KCSO is a game engine designed for 2d game development. Its coded in pure Java but we made it easier for you to code it by  adding draggable blocks. 

## Dragable Blocks Usage ##
Within the dragable block function there are many options for events, functions, handlers, listeners and much more. There will also be features 
that you can proccess live math. 

## Workspace ##
The workspace will have submenus for a hiarchy, object menu, tool selector, file access, and premade assests. You will also have the option to draw
or import your own images/assests.

## Drawing Tool ##
Included in the software there is a drawing tool where you can draw your own sprites and it will auto import it into your assests folder.
